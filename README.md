# Graph Data Structure and Knight's Travails problem

In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to 
implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics;
specifically, the field of graph theory. 
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of 
vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these
vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.
These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as
arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph.
The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities
represented by integer indices or references.

Goal of this project si to find shortest path from one position to another on
the chess board, as knight pieace (Knight's Travails).Before solving problem,
frist you need to make a board. In this implementation, board is made useing graph
data structrue with adjacency list. Adjacency list is implemented using linked list
data structure.
